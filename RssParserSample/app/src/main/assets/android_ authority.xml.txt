<p>Google is willing to foot the bill if your out-of-warranty <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-review-deep-dive-729702/">Google Pixel</a> has major motherboard issues — at least in one apparent case.</p>
<p>A Redditor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/8f74xe/psa_google_is_replacing_motherboards_for_the_og/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> their experience after their first-generation <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-xl-review-720243/">Pixel XL</a> refused to power back on. The user noted that their warranty had expired the previous month and Google refused to give them credit for a new phone. However, the Mountain View company suggested that the user contact repair chain UBreakiFix.</p>
<p>A store representative apparently told the user that the issue was &#8220;common&#8221; with the Pixel devices, adding that <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/new-gmail-interface-features-858908/">Google</a> was paying for the repairs.</p>
<p>The Redditor received a call from the chain a week after mailing their phone in for repairs, confirming that the motherboard was replaced and that &#8220;Google paid for it.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card" data-card-created="1525265678"><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/8f74xe/psa_google_is_replacing_motherboards_for_the_og/">PSA: Google is replacing motherboards for the OG Pixel and Pixel XL for free via UBreakIFix if you have the bricked/bootlooping issue.</a> from <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel">r/GooglePixel</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script></p>
<p>A second Redditor chimed in, saying that they had to try several UBreakiFix outlets before a third store confirmed that motherboard issues would be fixed for free.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve contacted UBreakiFix for clarification, but the repair chain didn&#8217;t directly address the report. &#8220;What I would recommend is to visit our locations for a free diagnostic service, and our technicians will provide you with more information about which repairs need to be done and pricing,&#8221; a sales representative told us.</p>
<p>We also emailed Google for a response, but the company hasn&#8217;t responded as of publication.</p>
<p>Some first-generation Pixels suffer from a major hardware fault, in the form of a <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-microphone-issues-755556/">tiny crack</a> in the solder of one of the microphones. It&#8217;s unclear whether the crack is responsible for motherboard issues as reported by this redditor.</p>

<p>After months in the spotlight for its role in Donald Trump&#8217;s 2016 presidential campaign, political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica and its parent company SLC Group announced today that it was shutting down.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Company is immediately ceasing all operations,&#8221; the company said in a <a href="https://ca-commercial.com/news/cambridge-analytica-and-scl-elections-commence-insolvency-proceedings-and-release-results-3">statement</a> posted earlier today on its website.</p>
<p>The closure was first reported by <a href="https://gizmodo.com/cambridge-analytica-just-shut-down-all-its-us-offices-1825698536?utm_medium=sharefromsite&amp;utm_source=Gizmodo_twitter"><em>Gizmodo</em></a>, which had obtained documents including a directive to American employees that they return their keycards immediately. The news was later confirmed by SLC Group founder Nigel Oakes in an interview with <em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/cambridge-analytica-closing-operations-following-facebook-data-controversy-1525284140">The Wall Street Journal</a>.</em></p>
<p>Included in <em>Gizmodo</em>&#8216;s initial report was the gallows humour within the company this morning. As revealed by screenshots of the company&#8217;s internal chat service, one employee had shared a Spotify playlist that included “High and Dry” by Radiohead, “The End” by The Doors, and “Help!” by The Beatles, while another employee shared a still from the film Titanic<em> </em>in which the band continues to play as the ship sinks.</p>
<div class="aa_srma_container shortcodes_wrapper right"><div class="shortcodes-header"><div class="shortcodes-title">Editor's Pick</div></div><div class="related_articles_wrapper"><div class="related_article_item"><a class="overlay-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/87m-facebook-users-affected-by-cambridge-analytica-852370/" title="87M Facebook users affected by Cambridge Analytica scandal, not 50M"></a><div class="ra-image" style="background-image: url(https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Facebook-logo.jpg)"><img class="hidden" src="https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Facebook-logo.jpg" alt="related article"></div><h4 class="ra-title">87M Facebook users affected by Cambridge Analytica scandal, not 50M</h4><div class="ra-excerpt">



Facebook: “Just kidding. It’s actually 87 million people who are affected by our data breach.”



By now, you probably know a thing or two about Cambridge Analytica: the British political consulting firm that not only worked …</div></div></div></div>
<p>The move is not entirely without warning, as the embattled company has been fighting off accusations that it had misused <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/87m-facebook-users-affected-by-cambridge-analytica-852370/">Facebook user data</a> and invaded <a href="https://dgit.com/facebook-messenger-data-breach-56671/">user privacy</a> in its work to support the president&#8217;s campaign.</p>
<p>Acknowledging the controversies that have plagued Cambridge Analytica, the statement stresses that the company stands by its actions and denies wrongdoing. &#8220;Over the past several months, Cambridge Analytica has been the subject of numerous unfounded accusations and, despite the Company’s efforts to correct the record, has been vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>Cambridge Analytica maintains unwavering confidence that its employees have acted ethically and lawfully.</p></blockquote>
<p>After suspending its chief executive, Alexander Nix, in March, Cambridge Analytica launched an independent investigation to determine if it had engaged in any wrongdoing. According to Cambridge Analytica, <a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/static.assets.commercial.prd.cambridgeanalytica.org/static_files/Malins+Report+re+Cambridge+Analytica+and+SCL+Elections+(4.27.18).pdf">the report</a> produced by that investigation fully supports the company&#8217;s &#8220;unwavering confidence that its employees have acted ethically and lawfully.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s statement includes the announcement that Cambridge Analytica LLC and some of its US-based affiliates will be filing for bankruptcy &#8220;soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>We will keep you updated as this story develops.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/xiaomi-mi-box-specs-price-release-date-719607/">Xiaomi Mi Box</a> (also known as the Mi Box 3) was one of the company&#8217;s more successful products in the west, owing to its cheap $69 price tag and availability via Walmart. It&#8217;s been stuck on <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-6-marshmallow-features-662856/">Android 6.0 Marshmallow</a> since its 2016 release, but it looks like the Chinese brand is pushing the update button.</p>
<p>According to threads on <em><a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/android-stick--console-computers/amlogic/mi-box-3-mdz-16-ab-oreo-t3784019" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XDA-Developers</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidTV/comments/8g73yl/mi_box_oreo_update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reddit</a></em> (both spotted by <em><a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/05/01/android-8-0-oreo-rolling-xiaomi-mi-box-owners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android Police</a></em>), several users have reported that their <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-android-tv-apps-544730/">Android TV</a>-powered box has been updated to <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-8-0-review-758783/">Android 8.0 Oreo</a>. In fact, one redditor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidTV/comments/8g73yl/mi_box_oreo_update/dy9m2tp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that they received the April 2018 security update alongside the feature release, posting images as well (below).</p>

<p>It seems like several update recipients were enrolled in the beta programme for the device, so they might be part of an early over-the-air release before an official update hits all Mi Box owners.</p>
<p>This would also mean that <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-xiaomi-phones-833837/">Xiaomi</a> has skipped <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-7-0-features-673002/">Android Nougat</a>, having only issued betas for 7.0 updates. It&#8217;s unclear what kind of features Xiaomi has brought with the new update, but Google has <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-assistant-available-nvidia-shield-tv-803391/">previously</a> <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-o-android-tv-773319/">confirmed</a> Assistant integration.<div class="aa_srma_container shortcodes_wrapper right"><div class="shortcodes-header"><div class="shortcodes-title">Editor's Pick</div></div><div class="related_articles_wrapper"><div class="related_article_item"><a class="overlay-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-android-tv-games-544460/" title="15 best Android TV games"></a><div class="ra-image" style="background-image: url(https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Grand-Theft-Auto-Liberty-City-Stories-Android-Game-1.jpg)"><img class="hidden" src="https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Grand-Theft-Auto-Liberty-City-Stories-Android-Game-1.jpg" alt="related article"></div><h4 class="ra-title">15 best Android TV games</h4><div class="ra-excerpt">
Android TV's release was exciting. Here was a platform that was more stable than Google TV and the developer community responded in kind by developing some awesome stuff for it. A little time has passed …</div></div></div></div></p>
<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, I haven&#8217;t received anything on my personal Mi Box, but I&#8217;ll keep checking and update this post accordingly.</p>
<p>The 2016 Mi Box isn&#8217;t the last streaming gadget from Xiaomi, having <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidTV/comments/8g73yl/mi_box_oreo_update/dy9m2tp/">launched</a> the Mi Box 4 and Mi Box 4C earlier this year. These boxes utilize the company&#8217;s PathWall interface for AI-based recommendations, albeit in China only. The Xiaomi Mi Box 4 offers 2GB of RAM and a Bluetooth remote, while the Mi Box 4C has 1GB and uses an IR remote instead.</p>

<p>Even though it launched less than a month ago, the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/fitbit-versa-review-845214/">Fitbit Versa</a> can be yours for at least $50 off — as long as you&#8217;re okay with putting in a bit of work.</p>
<p>Spotted by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/get-a-fitbit-versa-for-149-96/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>CNET</em></a>, the discount is only available at Macy&#8217;s. The store still displays the Versa&#8217;s regular $200 price tag on its website, but that changes once you <a href="https://emails.macys.com/pub/sf/FormLink?_ri_=X0Gzc2X%3DYQpglLjHJlTQGh2gzedMsTSvDzdzcrJDzckE7RzaN97mv2qzazc4Nh5hDhqmOVXMtX%3DYQpglLjHJlTQGzbrGAHX82vsU0NMmdze4y3LoRzcswsJezaskFM43TsVXyjLNpLOfhKLX%3D&amp;_ei_=EgkxTPbGBKHqOjssnpr52o4&amp;ranMID=3184&amp;ranEAID=isIkAyUyNbM&amp;ranSiteID=isIkAyUyNbM-xbTniEkG8jeOMRN_Bv7LhA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sign up</a> for Macy&#8217;s emails. Once you do that, wait 10 to 15 minutes for the 25-percent-off code to arrive in your inbox. From there, apply the code when you check out and the Versa should be available for $150.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that sales tax could still apply to your purchase, though shipping is free. Also, you can get an additional <a href="https://www.ebates.com/macys.com?query=macy&amp;position=2&amp;type=suggest&amp;store=8333" target="_blank" rel="noopener">six-percent rebate</a> from cashback service Ebates for Macy&#8217;s purchases. The rebate knocks the Versa&#8217;s price down to $141.</p>
<p>At that price, the Versa is dangerously close to impulse-buy territory. Fitbit&#8217;s smartwatch already undercut the 38mm Apple Watch Series 3, but the $141 price tag places an almost-$200 difference between itself and Apple&#8217;s offering.</p>
<div class="aa_srma_container shortcodes_wrapper right"><div class="shortcodes-header"><div class="shortcodes-title">Editor's Pick</div></div><div class="related_articles_wrapper"><div class="related_article_item"><a class="overlay-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/fitbit-versa-vs-ionic-850603/" title="Fitbit Versa vs Ionic: Which is the best Fitbit smartwatch?"></a><div class="ra-image" style="background-image: url(https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Fitbit-Versa-vs-Ionic-smartwatch-AA-5.jpg)"><img class="hidden" src="https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Fitbit-Versa-vs-Ionic-smartwatch-AA-5.jpg" alt="related article"></div><h4 class="ra-title">Fitbit Versa vs Ionic: Which is the best Fitbit smartwatch?</h4><div class="ra-excerpt">There are plenty of great smartwatches and fitness trackers out there, and the two newest offerings from Fitbit may have recently caught your attention. The Fitbit Versa and Ionic are two solid fitness watches that …</div></div></div></div>
<p>Whether that gulf is enough to consider the Versa over the Apple Watch and other smartwatches is a different question. As we learned in our review of the Versa, Fitbit&#8217;s offering is not for you if you need a powerful smartwatch. However, if you are a fan of Fitbit&#8217;s ecosystem, are not keen on spending $270 for the Ionic, and want a smartwatch that does not die after just one day of use, get the Versa.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Bloomberg</em> reports that there is a secret gaming startup called Google Arcade.</li>
<li>Arcade is reportedly head up by 21-year-old Alphabet employee Michael Sayman.</li>
<li>The platform will likely be focused on gaming, but also feature social network elements.</li>
</ul>
<p></div><hr>
<p>After rumors about a secret <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-assistant-startup-funding-861351/">Google</a> gaming project called Arcade surfaced this week, a Google spokesperson issued a statement on the matter. The company confirmed that Arcade exists and is “focused on mobile gaming with friends,” but declined to elaborate further.</p>
<p>“It’s a very early experiment, so there aren’t many details to share right now,” the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>According to a report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-02/google-wunderkind-is-building-a-secret-social-gaming-startup" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, 21-year-old Michael Sayman, pictured above, is in charge of Arcade’s development. Sayman started interning at <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-facebook-apps-for-android-527190/">Facebook</a> when he was only 17-years-old. He left Facebook for Google’s parent company Alphabet, Inc. last year.</p>
<p>The idea of a very young person heading up a mobile gaming project makes sense, as Google is likely looking for ways to lock teens and young adults into its ecosystem.</p>

Hot on the heels of the launch of Xiaomi's Black Shark gaming smartphone, Asus has appeared to confirm that it is working on a gaming phone of its own.

In an interview at the opening of Asus …</div></div></div></div>
<p>Although details on Arcade are scarce, sources told <em>Bloomberg</em> that the application itself is not a social network, but that games within the platform will likely become pseudo-social networks within themselves. Users sign up using their mobile phone number and play games with friends and strangers.</p>
<p>This is not the first time we’ve heard rumors about Google’s involvement with gaming. Back in February, we wrote about <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-game-streaming-service-yeti-835913/">a secret project codenamed “Yeti”</a> that appears to be a gaming streaming service. However, it is unlikely that Arcade and Yeti are the same thing.</p>
<p>Sayman is a part of Google’s experimental incubator known as <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/learn-to-code-for-free-grasshopper-856762/">Area 120</a>. As such, he likely gets a budget and can hire staff to work on Arcade in a low-risk environment. If Arcade is successful, it would be rolled into Google’s broader ecosystem. If not, it would simply wind down.</p>
<p>With the relative failure of Google Plus as compared to the other major social networks, Google is likely looking for new ways to bring Google into a more social network-type atmosphere. Arcade could be the answer.</p>
<p>What do you think? Does this sound like something you would join if it became a reality? Let us know in the comments!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/lastpass-vs-1password-vs-enpass-792139/">LastPass</a> is working on a new app that will make logging onto your computer a breeze.</p>
<p>LastPass Connect is currently in the beta testing stage. It will automatically unlock or lock your computer based on the proximity of your smartphone. When your phone is nearby, your computer will stay unlocked. Walk away with your smartphone, and it&#8217;ll lock. It&#8217;s quite handy.</p>
<p>This is similar to the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT206995">Auto Unlock feature</a> baked into Mac and Apple Watch devices, which doesn&#8217;t work with Android smartphones, nor with Windows machines. In fact, Auto Unlock doesn&#8217;t work with iPhones either. LastPass Connect is compatible with Android and iOS phones, as well as Windows and Mac computers.</p>
<p>As it&#8217;s in beta, Connect is not currently guaranteed to come to market. The company only sent out beta invites to a few select users thus far, though an open beta program isn&#8217;t out of the question.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-861393" src="https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/LastPass-Connect-desktop-app-screenshot-AA.jpg" alt="lastpass connect" width="305" height="229" srcset="https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/LastPass-Connect-desktop-app-screenshot-AA.jpg 305w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/LastPass-Connect-desktop-app-screenshot-AA-300x225.jpg 300w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/LastPass-Connect-desktop-app-screenshot-AA-16x12.jpg 16w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/LastPass-Connect-desktop-app-screenshot-AA-32x24.jpg 32w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/LastPass-Connect-desktop-app-screenshot-AA-28x21.jpg 28w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/LastPass-Connect-desktop-app-screenshot-AA-56x42.jpg 56w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/LastPass-Connect-desktop-app-screenshot-AA-64x48.jpg 64w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/LastPass-Connect-desktop-app-screenshot-AA-90x68.jpg 90w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/LastPass-Connect-desktop-app-screenshot-AA-266x200.jpg 266w" sizes="(max-width: 305px) 100vw, 305px" /></p>
<p>Setting it up is simple. Once you download LastPass Connect on your smartphone and computer, you&#8217;ll be required to scan a QR code that authenticates both devices.</p>
<p>From there, your computer will automatically lock if your phone is too far away. I&#8217;m not sure exactly how close your computer needs to be to your phone to stay connected, but I received a &#8220;Jimmy&#8217;s MacBook is now secure!&#8221; notification on my phone after walking to my yard. You can see the app in action in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iyNom1Qnd8">YouTube video</a>.</p>
<p>Once you come back to your locked computer, your can unlock your computer by either tapping any key on your keyboard or waiting for your phone to connect — no password required. If you don&#8217;t have your phone but need to get into your computer, you&#8217;ll just have to input your password to gain access. You can also disconnect your phone from Connect on the desktop if you happen to lose your phone.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-861349 size-large" src="https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/LastPass-Connect-app-AA-1-840x560.jpg" alt="lastpass connect app" width="840" height="560" srcset="https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/LastPass-Connect-app-AA-1-840x560.jpg 840w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/LastPass-Connect-app-AA-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/LastPass-Connect-app-AA-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/LastPass-Connect-app-AA-1-16x11.jpg 16w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/LastPass-Connect-app-AA-1-32x21.jpg 32w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/LastPass-Connect-app-AA-1-28x19.jpg 28w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/LastPass-Connect-app-AA-1-56x37.jpg 56w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/LastPass-Connect-app-AA-1-64x43.jpg 64w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/LastPass-Connect-app-AA-1-1000x666.jpg 1000w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/LastPass-Connect-app-AA-1-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/LastPass-Connect-app-AA-1.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /></p>
<p>I want to stress this app might not even make it past the beta testing phase. It all depends on what type of user feedback LastPass receives. That said, I have been using the app all day and it&#8217;s worked quite well so far, so I&#8217;m hopeful the company will launch this as a real add-on to its wonderful <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-password-manager-apps-android-353684/">password management</a> service.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all we know about Connect so far, but we&#8217;ll certainly keep you updated as we learn more.</p>

<ul>
<li>Hulu announced that it would soon offer downloadable content for offline viewing.</li>
<li>Details on the feature are scarce, but we assume it will be similar to Netflix&#8217;s downloadable content feature.</li>
<li>Hulu also announced a large jump in subscribers so far this year.</li>
</ul>
<p></div><hr>
<p>During the Hulu 18 Presentation in New York City, <a href="https://www.hulu.com/press/hulu-surges-past-20-million-u-s-subscribers-and-announces-plans-to-offer-advertising-in-live-tv-this-quarter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the media streaming service announced</a> its past successes and future plans. One of those plans is something that Hulu subscribers have wanted for a long time now: the ability to download content to watch offline at another time.</p>
<p>While <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/hulu-in-march-842903/">Hulu</a> did not commit to a specific date for the release of this new feature, it promised that it would land sometime in the “2018 – 2019 upfront season.”</p>
<p>Hulu currently offers <a href="https://signup.hulu.com/plans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two subscription plans</a>: “No Commercials” for $11.99 per month and “Limited Commercials” for $7.99 per month. Subscribers of either plan will be able to download movies and TV shows for offline viewing, but ad-supported subscribers will have non-skippable ads inserted into that offline content.</p>
<p>The company’s press release doesn’t say which devices and platforms will support offline viewing.</p>
<div class="aa_srma_container shortcodes_wrapper right"><div class="shortcodes-header"><div class="shortcodes-title">Editor's Pick</div></div><div class="related_articles_wrapper"><div class="related_article_item"><a class="overlay-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/hulu-spotify-bundle-854575/" title="The new Hulu Spotify bundle gives you both services for just $13 a month"></a><div class="ra-image" style="background-image: url(https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/hulu-spotify-bundle.jpg)"><img class="hidden" src="https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/hulu-spotify-bundle.jpg" alt="related article"></div><h4 class="ra-title">The new Hulu Spotify bundle gives you both services for just $13 a month</h4><div class="ra-excerpt">

These days, many of us subscribe to multiple streaming services for all sorts of content ranging from music, movies, television, and the list goes on. Spotify and Hulu want to make things at least a …</div></div></div></div>
<p>Hulu’s biggest competitor <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/netflix-march-842817/">Netflix</a> started offering <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/download-netflix-tv-shows-and-movies-687721/">downloadable content</a> in 2016. However, with Netflix, there is certain content you cannot download for offline viewing. It is unclear if Hulu’s service will have the same limitation or if the fact that the programs will have ad support will make it so that users can download all Hulu content.</p>
<p>In other Hulu news, the company announced that premium engagement with the service is up 60 percent this year and that three million subscribers joined since January 2018, bringing the company’s subscriber count to 20 million. For reference, Netflix last reported 55 million active subscribers.</p>
<p>Hulu also revealed that 78 percent of Hulu viewing takes place in the living room on connected televisions. This means that a relatively small percentage of subscribers use mobile devices to view Hulu content. This lines up closely with Netflix, which reported this year that <a href="https://www.recode.net/2018/3/7/17094610/netflix-70-percent-tv-viewing-statistics">70 percent of Netflix viewers</a> watch the service on a connected TV.</p>

<p>As part of a promotion, <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-samsung-phones-771831/">Samsung</a> is going to give you over $500 worth of credits towards in-app purchases in popular Android games like <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zeptolab.ctr2.f2p.google" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cut the Rope 2</a>. The catch? You have to use the obnoxiously superfluous Galaxy Apps store to get the credits.</p>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy Apps store is an exclusive store only available to owners of Galaxy-branded devices, like the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s9-plus-review-839879/">Samsung Galaxy S9</a>, <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s8-plus-review-760314/">S8</a>, <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-note-8-review-795053/">Note 8</a>, etc. It’s just like the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/apple-ad-google-play-store-859129/">Google Play Store</a>, but smaller and less useful.</p>
<p>To get the promotional credits, grab your Galaxy device and fire up the Galaxy Apps app. If you don’t know where it is because you’ve never used it before, that’s understandable; just search for “Galaxy” in your app drawer and it should be there.</p>
<div class="aa_srma_container shortcodes_wrapper right"><div class="shortcodes-header"><div class="shortcodes-title">Editor's Pick</div></div><div class="related_articles_wrapper"><div class="related_article_item"><a class="overlay-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-free-android-games-329736/" title="15 best free Android games of 2018!"></a><div class="ra-image" style="background-image: url(https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Final-Fantasy-Brave-Exvius-aa-watermark.jpg)"><img class="hidden" src="https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Final-Fantasy-Brave-Exvius-aa-watermark.jpg" alt="related article"></div><h4 class="ra-title">15 best free Android games of 2018!</h4><div class="ra-excerpt">
We all know that free Android games aren't always free these days, but many of them are very close if you have a little patience. Most Freemium bottlenecks occur when players get impatient and waiting …</div></div></div></div>
<p>Once in the Galaxy Apps app, tap on the icon in the top right corner that looks like a present. You’ll be guided through a series of prompts to enable the promotion and will eventually end up on a page with dozens of game icons. Tap on a game and it will tell you what you get for free. For example, Cut the Rope 2 gets you 10,000 candy coins, which is a value of $15.</p>
<p>You’ll have access to the freebies until May 16, so get on it soon. But don’t worry: the Galaxy Apps app isn’t going anywhere so it will still be there for you to use every day once the promotion is over.</p>
<p>Just kidding, this is probably the first and last time you’ll open the app.</p>

<ul>
<li>Per order of The Pentagon, Huawei and ZTE technology cannot be sold on U.S. military bases.</li>
<li>This is not a ban on the devices, but rather a ban on buying the devices on-base.</li>
<li>The Pentagon says it is considering issuing a military-wide advisory statement on the use of Huawei and ZTE equipment.</li>
</ul>
<p></div><hr>
<p>By order of The Pentagon, all retail establishments located on United States military bases must cease selling devices made by both <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-huawei-phones-783870/">Huawei</a> and <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-zte-phones-802238/">ZTE</a>. The Department of Defense reasons that using devices made by those Chinese manufacturers could <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/huawei-refutes-claim-risk-us-national-security-571402/">pose a security risk</a>.</p>
<p>In a statement a Pentagon representative gave to <em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/pentagon-asking-military-bases-to-remove-huawei-zte-phones-1525262076?mod=djemalertNEWS&amp;ns=prod/accounts-wsj&amp;ns=prod/accounts-wsj&amp;ns=prod/accounts-wsj&amp;ns=prod/accounts-wsj&amp;ns=prod/accounts-wsj&amp;ns=prod/accounts-wsj" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Wall Street Journal</a></em>, the DoD says that “Huawei and ZTE devices may pose an unacceptable risk to the department’s personnel, information, and mission. In light of this information, it was not prudent for the department’s exchanges to continue selling them.”</p>
<div class="aa_srma_container shortcodes_wrapper right"><div class="shortcodes-header"><div class="shortcodes-title">Editor's Pick</div></div><div class="related_articles_wrapper"><div class="related_article_item"><a class="overlay-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-huawei-phones-783870/" title="Here are the best Huawei phones you can buy right now"></a><div class="ra-image" style="background-image: url(https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Huawei-logo-2.jpg)"><img class="hidden" src="https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Huawei-logo-2.jpg" alt="related article"></div><h4 class="ra-title">Here are the best Huawei phones you can buy right now</h4><div class="ra-excerpt">

China-based Huawei makes and sells a lot of different smartphones, and it can get quite confusing for consumers who might want to buy one for themselves. There are plenty of choices for people who want …</div></div></div></div>
<p>To be clear, this order does not ban the use of Huawei and ZTE equipment from military bases, and military personnel can still obtain and keep devices purchased from other retail establishments. Though The Pentagon did clarify that it is considering sending out a military-wide advisory about the perceived dangers of Huawei and ZTE hardware.</p>
<p>Huawei, in response to the ban, issued a statement to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/2/17310870/pentagon-ban-huawei-zte-phones-retail-stores-military-bases" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Verge</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Huawei’s products are sold in 170 countries worldwide and meet the highest standards of security, privacy, and engineering in every country we operate globally, including the US. We remain committed to openness and transparency in everything we do and want to be clear that no government has ever asked us to compromise the security or integrity of any of our networks or devices.”</p></blockquote>
<p>ZTE has yet to issue a statement of its own on the matter.</p>
<p>According to an anonymous source speaking with <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>, military leaders are worried that China could use Huawei and ZTE devices to locate soldiers in the field. Both Huawei and ZTE state that no such capability exists.</p>

<p>This new military declaration is one of many setbacks that both Huawei and ZTE have had recently. Huawei, in response to these and other issues with the United States government, has <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/huawei-in-america-856241/">scaled back its intentions</a> to break into America significantly. ZTE, however, faces more significant problems since American companies are now <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/how-screwed-is-zte-right-now-856106/">banned from selling products</a> to the Chinese smartphone manufacturer. However, this is unrelated to the threat of Chinese spying and instead due to its flagrant violations of Iranian trade bans.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/huawei-p20-pro-review-853352/">Huawei P20 Pro</a> is currently one of the best-reviewed Android phones and setting <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/huawei-p20-pro-europe-sales-859899/">sales records globally</a>. It is not available in the United States.</p>

	<media:content name="AndroidAuthority" url="https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/LG-G7-ThinQ-Top7_Image-300x169.jpg" medium="image" />			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="video-container">

</div>
<p><a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-lg-phones-775532/">LG</a> loves to pack in as many features as physically possible into its smartphones. The <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/lg-v30-review-797089/">LG V30</a> was hailed as a camera lover&#8217;s dream with its wide-angle lens, and the headphone jack has remained in the company&#8217;s entire flagship lineup.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/lg-g7-review-860652/">LG G7 ThinQ</a> is no different.</p>
<p>You can check out all the new features present in this phone <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/lg-g7-review-860652/">in our hands-on video</a>, but here are the top seven features we think make this phone so great for enthusiasts.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-860744 size-large" title="" src="https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/LG-G7-Hands-On-9-of-18-840x560.jpg" alt="LG G7" width="840" height="560" srcset="https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/LG-G7-Hands-On-9-of-18-840x560.jpg 840w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/LG-G7-Hands-On-9-of-18-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/LG-G7-Hands-On-9-of-18-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/LG-G7-Hands-On-9-of-18-16x11.jpg 16w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/LG-G7-Hands-On-9-of-18-32x21.jpg 32w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/LG-G7-Hands-On-9-of-18-28x19.jpg 28w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/LG-G7-Hands-On-9-of-18-56x37.jpg 56w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/LG-G7-Hands-On-9-of-18-64x43.jpg 64w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/LG-G7-Hands-On-9-of-18-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/LG-G7-Hands-On-9-of-18-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /></p>
<h2>Boom-box speaker</h2>
<div class="aa_srma_container shortcodes_wrapper right"><div class="shortcodes-header"><div class="shortcodes-title">Editor's Pick</div></div><div class="related_articles_wrapper"><div class="related_article_item"><a class="overlay-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/lg-g7-dts-x-virtual-surround-sound-861225/" title="What is DTS:X virtual surround sound in the LG G7 ThinQ?"></a><div class="ra-image" style="background-image: url(https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/lg-g7-thinq-hands-on-aa-42-of-49.jpg)"><img class="hidden" src="https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/lg-g7-thinq-hands-on-aa-42-of-49.jpg" alt="related article"></div><h4 class="ra-title">What is DTS:X virtual surround sound in the LG G7 ThinQ?</h4><div class="ra-excerpt">

The new LG G7 ThinQ boasts a number of impressive audio features. One that might be new to you is something called DTS:X technology. In a nutshell, DTS:X is a relatively new surround sound audio …</div></div></div></div>
<p>LG isn&#8217;t using front-firing speakers on this thing, but can still get loud. In fact, this phone has one of the loudest speakers available on the market, going head to head with the likes of the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/razer-phone-review-811436/">Razer Phone</a> in loudness and sound quality.</p>
<p>The G7 ThinQ&#8217;s body acts as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance_chamber">resonance chamber</a> that really boosts the bass and volume. It actually works really well. If you put your finger up to the speaker on the bottom of the device, you can actually feel air being pushed out of the phone. Music sounds crisp and clear even at high volumes. We were really surprised how much sound you could get out of this thing.</p>
<p>If you love playing your music loudly in the shower or with your friends, this is an awesome feature to have.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-860736 size-large" title="" src="https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/LG-G7-Hands-On-1-of-18-840x560.jpg" alt="LG G7" width="840" height="560" srcset="https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/LG-G7-Hands-On-1-of-18-840x560.jpg 840w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/LG-G7-Hands-On-1-of-18-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/LG-G7-Hands-On-1-of-18-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/LG-G7-Hands-On-1-of-18-16x11.jpg 16w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/LG-G7-Hands-On-1-of-18-32x21.jpg 32w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/LG-G7-Hands-On-1-of-18-28x19.jpg 28w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/LG-G7-Hands-On-1-of-18-56x37.jpg 56w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/LG-G7-Hands-On-1-of-18-64x43.jpg 64w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/LG-G7-Hands-On-1-of-18-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/LG-G7-Hands-On-1-of-18-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /></p>
<h2>Super bright display</h2>
<p>The LG G7 ThinQ doesn&#8217;t use an OLED panel, and that&#8217;s ok. I would personally prefer a high quality <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/poled-vs-ips-lcd-display-technology-explained-798207/">LCD</a> panel over a sub-par <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/flexible-oled-displays-841119/">OLED</a>. It seems like LG is being a bit more careful after their inconsistent <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/lg-v30-poled-vs-samsung-super-amoled-797330/">OLED fiasco</a> in the LG V30.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Don&#8217;t miss:</strong></em><em> <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/lg-g7-specs-860763/">The full list of LG G7 ThinQ specs</a></em></p>
<p>There are benefits to LCD, too. This panel gets really bright, up to 1,000 nits. You should be able to see your screen in pretty much any lighting condition, whether in a dark room or direct sunlight. While this might wear down the 3,000mAh battery rather quickly, we&#8217;re glad to have to option to crank the brightness up to 11 if needed.</p>

<h2>Front and back portrait modes</h2>
<p>LG&#8217;s portrait mode is a little different than what you&#8217;ll find on <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-2-portrait-mode-comparison-836896/">other phones</a>.</p>
<p>The portrait modes in the G7 ThinQ creates a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_map">depth map</a> of the scene, letting you adjust the depth of field as you see fit. Because it attaches this depth map to the image, you can even adjust the depth of field after the photo is taken, which is pretty cool.</p>
<p>This works on the front camera as well, which is uncommon for smartphones right now. The <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-2-xl-review-805069/">Pixel 2</a> and <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s9-vs-iphone-x-camera-850808/">iPhone X</a> are some of the only devices that have a front-facing portrait mode. We haven&#8217;t had much time to test exactly how well this camera performs the effect, but we&#8217;re eager to test it out in our full review down the road.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-860747 size-large" title="" src="https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/LG-G7-Hands-On-12-of-18-840x560.jpg" alt="LG G7" width="840" height="560" srcset="https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/LG-G7-Hands-On-12-of-18-840x560.jpg 840w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/LG-G7-Hands-On-12-of-18-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/LG-G7-Hands-On-12-of-18-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/LG-G7-Hands-On-12-of-18-16x11.jpg 16w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/LG-G7-Hands-On-12-of-18-32x21.jpg 32w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/LG-G7-Hands-On-12-of-18-28x19.jpg 28w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/LG-G7-Hands-On-12-of-18-56x37.jpg 56w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/LG-G7-Hands-On-12-of-18-64x43.jpg 64w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/LG-G7-Hands-On-12-of-18-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/LG-G7-Hands-On-12-of-18-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /></p>
<h2>AI Camera</h2>
<p>Like many other flagships out today, this phone can detect different scenes to help you get the right settings automatically. The G7 ThinQ gives you more control than most phones, which mainly just change the settings and do things like saturate the color.</p>
<p>The phone recognizes up to 18 different scenes — like pets, landscapes, and people — with four different filter options for each. This gives you more control when you take the photo itself, and you might not even want to throw on additional filters afterwards.</p>
<p>The pro mode gives even more control over the camera, but if you just want a good, quick shot this feature is really great to have.</p>

The LG G7 ThinQ is official as of this morning. We now know that the extra hardware button that caused much speculation over the past few months is a dedicated button used to launch Google …</div></div></div></div>
<p>While <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-samsung-phones-771831/">Samsung</a> has the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/disable-bixby-samsung-galaxy-s9-851519/">Bixby button</a> and Google has Active Edge, LG opted for a <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-assistant-838138/">Google Assistant</a> button on the side of the LG G7 ThinQ. I personally love this. It&#8217;s nice to be able to instantly trigger Google Assistant without needing to mutter the hotword.</p>
<p>The squeeze feature is one of my favorite features on the Pixel 2, and I&#8217;m happy to have something similar to use here. This is extremely useful for when you&#8217;re walking down the street and have a question, or if you just want to find the best coffee shop nearby.</p>
<p>LG says this button won&#8217;t be remappable out the gate, but it&#8217;s listening to feedback and may enable this feature in a future software update if that&#8217;s what customers want. If that&#8217;s something you would use, be sure to be vocal about it in the comments section down below.</p>

<h2>IP68 water resistance</h2>
<p>Every phone should be water resistant. I&#8217;ve been vocal about this ever since my Pixel&#8217;s speaker stopped working from rain damage, and I&#8217;ll continue to chant it until it is standard throughout the industry. Luckily, LG has outfitted the G7 ThinQ with <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/ip-ratings-explained-746306/">IP68 water resistance</a>.</p>
<p>You can go swimming with this phone and take pictures underwater, take it out on the boat with no worries, or even blast music in the shower using those super-loud boombox speakers. It&#8217;s not a new feature or one that&#8217;s exclusive to the G7 ThinQ, but having water resistance on your phone is awesome.</p>

<h2>New second screen</h2>
<p>LG is bringing back the popular secondary screen of the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/lg-v20-review-713915/">V20</a> using the notch. The G7 ThinQ will display supplementary information in the screen area on either side of the display&#8217;s notch. You will also be able to fill it in with black, grey, or even a gradient of color if you just <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/i-love-notch-853814/">hate the notch</a> that much.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t much different than regular notch devices, but LG is giving you a lot more control over what you show in that extra bit of screen than just getting rid of it. <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/huawei-p20-camera-night-mode-859705/">Huawei</a> first gave you the option to hide it with the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/huawei-p20-pro-review-853352/">P20</a>, but I think more manufacturers need to give you this control.</p>
